    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1/4 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon taco seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups enchilada sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef and onion in the hot skillet until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>Stir 1 cup Cheddar cheese, taco seasoning, and black pepper into ground beef until cheese is melted. Mix in enchilada sauce, chili powder, garlic, and salt; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lay a tortilla onto a work surface and spoon about 1/4 cup meat sauce down the center of tortilla. Top meat sauce with 1 tablespoon black beans and a sprinkling of black olives. Roll up tortilla, enclosing filling; lay seam-side down in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas.</li>
        <li>Spoon any remaining meat sauce over rolled tortillas. Scatter any remaining black beans over the top. Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, 20 to 22 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
